Current Work
======
I am a MS/PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Columbia University, where I have been selected as a recipient of the Blavatnik Presidential Fellowship. I conduct research in the Neural Acoustic Processing Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Nima Mesgarani. My expertise lies in the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and signal processing.

Undergraduate
======
I graduated from Duke University in 2024 with a BSE in Biomedical Engineering, a BSE in Electrical and Computer Engineering, a BS in Mathematics, and minors in Computer Science and Philosophy. I took part in different research projects, supervised by Dr.Pratik Chhatbar, Dr.Leslie Collins, and Dr.Hau-Tieng Wu.

Outside of Research
======
Outside school, I enjoy weight lifting, running, tennis, and watching movies/shows. One of my favorite hobbies in NYC is going to different museums for free.
